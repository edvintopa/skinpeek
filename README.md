# Skinpeek
Skinpeek let's you search for any Minecraft player and find their skin.

## How it works
- User inputs a players username into the search field.
- **PlayerDB** does a search and returns the players UUID.
- **Crafatar** uses the UUID to return the players skin and some renders of it.
- Skinpeek displays the players skin.
